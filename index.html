		<p>In the fall of 2012 I took a trip to Mount Washington in New Hampshire. Instead of climbing to the summit on foot, I took the cog railway from the base to the summit. The single car train wound its way up a steep track, offering clear views of the the surrounding mountains, before arriving at the visitor center 20 minutes later. The summit had several points of interest including a weather station and a museum of the mountain's history. After a few hours of exploring and enjoying the view I took the train back down the mountain.</p>
